Bulletin board project which aims to replace a [CoolForum](https://github.com/dsoriano/coolforum) solution. (DB migration script included.) Comes with a light community blog.

Made in Python 3. Backend mostly based on Django, PostgreSQL and memcached. Frontend in BootStrap + JQuery. Bits of nodejs + socket.io for realtime capabilities.
